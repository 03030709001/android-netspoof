Network Spoofer
===============

Network Spoofer lets you change websites on other peopleâ€™s computers from an Android phone.
This project is a port and adaptation of the Upside-down-ternet - http://www.ex-parrot.com/pete/upside-down-ternet.html - to Android.
Please note that there is no intention for Network Spoofer to include any malicious features. This application is a fun demonstration of how vulnerable home networks are to simple attacks, with permission of the network owner - DO NOT attempt to use Network Spoofer on any corporate or other non-residential networks (eg. at school, university). It becomes very obvious when Network Spoofer is being used on a Network, and use of Network Spoofer will be considered malicious hacking by network administrators.
